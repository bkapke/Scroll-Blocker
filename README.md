==============

A simple library to stop scrolling when the mouse wheel is used on top of fixed containers.  

###A simple jQuery backed scroll arrester</h2>
Quickly block un-intentional background scrolling when certain elements are scrolled or touched.
Un-intentional scrolling and bouncing can make an app's layout seem loose and sloppy.
